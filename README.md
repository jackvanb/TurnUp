# TurnUp 
ðŸ“²TurnUp is an iOS app to discover and engage with events on your campus. Users can RSVP for events, chat in the event thread, and up-vote or down-vote messages. TurnUp makes events easy. Sign-up with an anonymous username, and start to TurnUp!
 
## Background
 
As university students, events are posted on a variety of mediums. TurnUp aims to provide a single source for all events taking place at your campus. With the app, you can submit your event and be posted to the feed for your school. Students can ask questions about the event, and event organizers can see how many people are expected to come.
